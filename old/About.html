               <h4>Lifestyle</h4>
               I enjoy spending quality time with my lovely wife Anne and our awesome puppy Cora. We got Married December 30, 2014 and are loving our humble little apartment. Weve been together since March 2014 and have loved every minute of it!<br>
               Anne is a Psychology Major and will graduate here soon. But we're not going anywhere soon, because I still have quite a while. She has all sisters, I have all brothers, and even though we're very different we still manage to make a pretty great team. Im looking forward to sharing my life with her.<br>
               Though i currently have been working for the schools IT department, I hope to one day be able to work in some form of software development, my skills really seem to excel in that area, especially in debugging and optimizing code. <br><br><hr>
               <h4>History</h4>
               I grew up in the Denver Metro area of Colorado and still think it is the greatest state. 300 days of sun each year, any sport (aside from ocean related ones...), and the beautiful Rocky Mountains in my backyard. If you don't like the weather, wait 15mins because it is sure to change.<br>
               I worked all through High School, and managed to get a Scholarship from one of my jobs. I also was a full fledged band geek. After I graduated Thunder Ridge High School I began attending Brigham Young University Idaho. I quickly discovered my knack for programming began studying Computer Science.<br>
               After a 2 year deferrment for a fulltime volunteer service mission for my church i returned to my college studies at BYUI. I have now been here for 8 semesters, but i still have a ways to go. "sigh"... Cant wait to graduate... Which is scheduled for April 2017<br>
